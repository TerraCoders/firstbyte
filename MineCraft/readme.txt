These Bash scripts are written for the Java (paper.jar) version of MineCraft Server (1.17+) built on
balenaCloud for the Raspberry Pi. 

I've specifically written these scripts to encourage my kids (currently 6th graders) to manage their
MC server. I use lolcat, jp2a and cowsay to keep things colorful and fun. You can either remove these
commands from the scripts or you can install them with apt.
